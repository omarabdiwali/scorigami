## Overview

Scorigami is a collection of web applications that track unique scores in various sports, also known as "scorigami." Scorigami is a concept thought up by Jon Bois, referring to a score that has never been seen before in a sport's history.

## Projects

The Scorigami project consists of multiple sub-projects, each tracking a different sport:

* **NBA Scorigami**: Tracks unique NBA scores and tweets from [@ScorigamiNBA_](https://x.com/ScorigamiNBA_)
	+ Visit the website at: https://scorigami-nba.vercel.app
	+ [Source code](https://github.com/omarabdiwali/scorigami/tree/main/nba)
	+ The application checks for new game scores every 2 minutes and tweets new scores from the [@ScorigamiNBA_](https://x.com/ScorigamiNBA_) Twitter account if a scorigami occurs.
* **NFL Scorigami**: Tracks unique NFL scores and tweets from [@NFLScorigamiBot](https://x.com/NFLScorigamiBot)
	+ Visit the website at: https://nfl-scorigami.vercel.app
	+ [Source code](https://github.com/omarabdiwali/scorigami/tree/main/nfl)
	+ The application checks for new game scores every minute on gamedays and tweets new scores from the [@NFLScorigamiBot](https://x.com/NFLScorigamiBot) Twitter account if a scorigami occurs.

## Technical Details

All sub-projects are built using Next.js and use the following technologies:

* **Frontend**: Next.js, React
* **Backend**: Next.js API routes
* **Database**: MongoDB (using Mongoose for ORM)
* **Twitter API**: Twitter-api-v2 library for interacting with the Twitter API

## Features

Both Scorigami applications feature an interactive chart showcasing all unique scores throughout the sport's history. The chart is updated daily and provides a visual representation of the scorigami data.

Additionally, both applications include a live game center that displays:
* Real-time scores for ongoing games
* Upcoming scheduled games with dates and times
* Final results with winning teams highlighted
* Team logos, names, and current records
* Game status indicators
